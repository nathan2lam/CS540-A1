Written in C++.
Program will display a menu and take user input to determine which system command to execute. 
User will enter (1-6) to indicate input and other input will not do anything, until valid input is given.
There will be follow-up instruction if further input is needed for the command. 
Program will execute, display its contents, and indicate success or failure.
It will continute until '6' is entered, indicating exit.

This program allowed me to understand system commands as well as incorporate them into a programming project, as I have only ever run these commands in the terminal and not in a program. It allowed me to understand programming better and incorporate operating system knowledge.
